# JavaGame3D

## Overview
![LWJGL](https://img.shields.io/badge/LWJGL-3.3.6-green.svg)

JavaGame3D is a lightweight 3D engine developed in Java, leveraging the power of the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL). This project serves as a foundational exploration into 3D graphics programming, implementing core features necessary for creating interactive three-dimensional applications.

## Features

The engine currently supports the following key features:

- **Comprehensive Input Handling**: Full support for camera and object control via keyboard and mouse inputs, allowing for fluid and intuitive navigation within the 3D space.
- **Performance Monitoring**: An integrated frames-per-second (FPS) counter is displayed on-screen to provide real-time feedback on rendering performance.
- **Texture Mapping**: The engine includes functionality to apply 2D textures to 3D models, enhancing visual fidelity and allowing for more detailed and realistic objects and environments.

## Technology Stack

The project is built upon the following core technologies:

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for the engine's logic and structure.
- **LWJGL 3**: A low-level Java library that provides direct access to native APIs such as OpenGL, which is used for rendering all graphics in this project.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or a newer version.
- An IDE that supports Maven or Gradle for dependency management (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OleksandrVovchenko/JavaGame3D.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Allow the IDE to download and configure the necessary dependencies via its build tool.
4. Run the main application file to start the engine.

## Future Roadmap

Future development will focus on expanding the engine's capabilities, with plans to include:

- Advanced lighting and shadow systems.
- A basic physics engine for collision detection and response.
- Support for loading various 3D model formats.
- A scene management system for complex environments.
